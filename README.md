Introduction
========================
This repository is a home for snippets of YAML code and a sample hello world server of scripting for the Harness CI Community.

## Layout

The repository is broken up into six directories currently:

**[Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)**<br>
**[Requirements](docs/requirements.md)**<br>
**[Harness Sample YAML](https://github.com/codewdhruv/Nodejs-Sample-Pipeline/tree/main/.harness)**<br>
**[Getting Started](#GettingStarted)**<br>
**[Workflow](#Workflow)**<br>
**[Build Instructions](docs/build.md)**<br>


## Getting Started

Use this README to get started with our sample pipeline repository for Nodejs. This guide outlines the basics of getting started with the Harness CI and provides a full code sample for you to try out.
This sample doesnâ€™t include configuration options, for in depth steps and configuring the pipeline for example using triggers or using our templates see the  [Pipeline Configuration Docs](#).

Here we have build a simple two-stage CI Pipeline in Harness. Setting up and running the Pipeline will take about 30 minutes.
The Pipeline will build and run a unit test on a sample nodejs repository upload the artifact to Docker Hub and then run integration tests.
You can use publicly-available code, images, and your Github and Docker Hub accounts.

## Workflow

- Use a Kubernetes cluster build farm.
- Build the code and run unit tests in the build farm.
- Package the app as a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub.
- Pull the uploaded image to the build farm as a Background Task. Check out more about background tasks [here](google.com)
- Run an integration test against the sample app.

## Setting up the Build Stage

The first move towards releasing software is the build stage. Optimizing the build stage will accelerate the development workflow and cut down costs. This is where the specification is done for the end-to-end workflow for the build: the codebase to build, the infrastructure to build it, where to post the finished artifact, and any additional tasks (such as automated tests or validations).

To run a build, a Build Stage needs to connect to the codebase, the build infrastructure, and the artifact repository.
A Connector is a configurable object that connects to an external resource automatically.
